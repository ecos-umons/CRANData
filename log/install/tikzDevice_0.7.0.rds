Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'tikzDevice', details:

  error: 

An appropriate LaTeX compiler could not be found.
Access to LaTeX is required in order for the TikZ device
to produce output.

The following places were tested for a valid LaTeX compiler:

	the global option: tikzLatex
	the environment variable: R_LATEXCMD
	the environment variable: R_PDFLATEXCMD
	the global option: latexcmd
	the PATH using the command: pdflatex
	the PATH using the command: latex
	the PATH using the command: /usr/texbin/pdflatex

If you have a working LaTeX compiler, try one of the
following solutions:

	Set the path to your compiler as the value of either latexcmd or
	tikzLatex in .Rprofile using options().

	Set the path to your compiler as the value of either R_LATEXCMD or
	R_PDFLATEXCMD in .Renviron.

	Ensure the folder containing your compiler is included in PATH.
